### What I learned
-through this project ,I've improved my understanding on how to properly style interactive elemnts like buttons and links using CSS.I've learned that styling the parent element(<li>) does not always affect the child(<a>).I had to turn inline elements into block-level elements in order for it to fill the full width of its container.
